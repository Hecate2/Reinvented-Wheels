# Reinvented-Wheels
一些小工具（重新发明的轮子）  
  
我们都不想重新发明轮子，然而有时候就是没有办法  
  
GPAcalc: Weighted average to calculate your GPA. (What a tiresome work to write such codes!)  
  
IgnaleoG: Combat-proven *destroyer* (a type of battleship) sending HTTP requests with stability and virtually unlimited concurrency. It runs as an HTTP server, and launches jobs on your HTTP request. Example offered at https://github.com/Hecate2/ISML_auto_voter. Recommended accessories: retryapi.py & compat.py.  
  
retryapi.py & compat.py: They provide decorators for non-asynchronous functions. Retry running the decorated function for a few times when an Exception occurs in the function.  
  
arrayvideo: plays a 3-dimensional numpy array[height, width, number_of_frames] as a video on Windows  

grayimg: transform any image into gray a one. Just faster and more convenient than heavy softwares.
